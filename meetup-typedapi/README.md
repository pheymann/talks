## In Short
Have you ever thought “I really like Haskell’s Servant. Why don’t we have something like that in Scala?” or “Why can't I just define my APIs as types and Scala does the heavy lifting?”? If so, this talk is made for you.

I will tell you a short story about excitement, pain and hate peaking in a climax of type-driven enlightenment. I will tell you my journey of developing Typedapi, a library for building typesafe APIs which moves as many computations to the type level as possible.

We will fight many a beast on our way from Scala’s desugaring to folds working just on types. But eventually, we will arrive at our destination, exhausted, with scars but also able to make our code a bit safer again.
