### In Short
In this talk we will start our journey into the realm of Functional Programming with Scala and Cats beginning with a short introduction into the concept of: 

 - Functions and Data 

and continue by visiting: 

 - Functors and Monads.

This journey is meant to be a gateway to become Alice in FP-Wonderland and create a knowledge foundation which can be used to discover more advanced concepts. No prior knowledge of Functional Programming is necessary to follow this talk and I will try my best to provide my fellow travellers with real-world examples which show possible use cases and why using FP in a day-to-day business makes sense.
